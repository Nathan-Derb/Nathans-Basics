        <h2>Engineering Aspiration's</h2>
        <p>I want to become a valuable assest without leaving my family. I started work as a cable linemen like my
            parents, it paid the bills but I rarely saw them growing up. At the rate I was damaging my body and losing
            my family I needed to change. After months of weighing my career options all conclusions pointed towards
            software engineering. </p>
